# Task: Advanced Planning
# Status: TODO

## Objective
Port advanced planning features from Python to C++, including WorkGraph decomposition and deterministic execution.

## Requirements
- Implement `plan decompose`: Use AI to break down a request into a WorkGraph.
- Implement `plan enact`: Materialize a WorkGraph into Track/Phase/Task filesystem structure.
- Implement `plan run`: Execute a plan with a deterministic runner.
- Implement `plan score`: Rank tasks by priority and purpose.
- Implement `plan recommend`: Get next best actions from the WorkGraph.
