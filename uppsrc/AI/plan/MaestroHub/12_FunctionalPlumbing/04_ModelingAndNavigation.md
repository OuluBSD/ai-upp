# Task: Modeling Synthesis & Seamless Navigation

# Status: TODO

# Description
Implement the AI logic for synthesizing models from code and improve the navigation between disparate functional hubs.

# Objectives
- Implement "Code -> Workflow" synthesis logic: AI scans files, creates tasks, and maps workflow nodes.
- Implement "Seamless Navigation": add "Go to [X]" buttons and right-click menus that switch tabs and pass context (e.g., "Go to TU" from a log entry).
- Implement "Navigation History" (Back/Next buttons) for tab switching.
- Support "AI Discussion-Assisted Runbook Authoring": update runbooks via AI chat using JSON examples.

# UI Requirements
- Add "Back/Next" icons to the main toolbar.
- Ensure context-sensitive menus are populated across all panes.
