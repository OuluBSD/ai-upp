# Task: Core Architecture Alignment
# Status: TODO

## Objective
Review the current GUI design against the "Core Product Architecture" (Section A of Features.md).

## Requirements
- **Layered Lifecycle**: Does the UI guide the user through the `init` -> `runbook` -> `workflow` -> `repo` -> `plan` -> `make` -> `run` sequence?
- **Dual Control Paths**: Are the Human-facing (Chat) and AI-facing (Execution) paths clearly distinguished yet interoperable?
- **Traceability**: Is there a "Global Audit Trail" or "History" that links all artifacts?

## Deliverables
- Alignment report and UI refinement recommendations in `uppsrc/MaestroHub/Architecture_Alignment.md`.
