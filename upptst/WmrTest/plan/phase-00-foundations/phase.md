Phase 00 - Foundations

Goals
- Define coordinate spaces and transforms for camera, IMU, fusion, and world/map.
- Define data model, timing model, and storage for frames, keypoints, matches, and pose history.
- Decide on SoftHMD vs SoftVR merging strategy.

Exit Criteria
- Documented space graph and transform conventions.
- Clear interface for sensor packets and timestamps.
- A plan for calibration artifacts and persistence.
