I will read the `rb-drawing-pencil-red-save.ugui` file to understand the expected format and content of the formal logic constraints, which will help me derive appropriate constraints even if the provided runbook is empty.

I will read the `docs/maestro/plans/constraints/rb-6889952d.ugui` file to see if it contains existing constraints for that runbook ID.
I will read `test_constraints.py` to see if it contains any information that could clarify the expected formal logic constraints for the drawing application.
