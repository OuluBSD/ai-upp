# Track 13: Advanced Intelligence & Simulation

# Goal
Elevate MaestroHub from a "plumbing" prototype to a capable engineering assistant by implementing real integration (GDB, Graph Visualization) and advanced AI simulation features.

# Tasks
1. [x] **Visual State Editor**: Implement PUML-to-GraphLib rendering in `StateEditor`.
2. [x] **Real GDB Integration**: Replace the `GdbService` stub with a functioning GDB/MI client.
3. [x] **Multi-Agent Simulation**: Visualize agent-to-agent conversations in `MaestroAssistant`.
4. [ ] **Live Observability**: Implement real-time file tailing for `LogAnalyzer`.
5. [ ] **Plugin System**: Define an interface for external tools to plug into MaestroHub.
