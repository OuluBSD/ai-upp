# Task: Trust & Transparency (AI UX)
# Status: TODO

## Objective
Design how MaestroHub communicates AI "thought" and handles human intervention.

## Research Questions
- **Observability**: Is the AI's current tool call (e.g., "Reading file X") visible enough? Is it too noisy?
- **Intervention**: When the AI proposes a "destructive" action (editing code), how is trust established? Is the diff preview clear?
- **The "Stuck" State**: How does the user know if the AI is looped or just thinking? What is the "Panic Button" experience?

## Deliverables
- AI Interaction Guidelines in `uppsrc/MaestroHub/AI_UX_Guidelines.md`.
