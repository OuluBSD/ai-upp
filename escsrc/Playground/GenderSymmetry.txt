What:
	This is more like a pipeline
		1. Take input or a sample of discussion (like when someone comments an news article = article + comment)
		2. Consider it both straight and with inversed genders (use AI for inversion)
		3. Compare straight and inversed analysis
			- anonymise them (strip to components without genders ---> get close to "pure logic")
			- pick the logical truth: straight or inversed
		3b. in case of inversed truth; try to explain the inversion in the larger context (why it might happen usually)
		4. use previous information to generate "balanced answer" (put user's own fine-tuning request here)
