# Task: User Perspective Analysis
# Status: DONE

## Objective
Analyze MaestroHub and MaestroCLI from the perspective of a new user to identify friction points and emotional reactions.

## Research Questions
- **First Reaction**: What does the user see when they first open the GUI? Is it overwhelming or welcoming?
- **User Needs**: What is the primary problem the user is trying to solve (e.g., "I have a bug I can't find", "I need to port this code")?
- **Fulfillment**: How does the program guide the user toward the solution? Is the path from "Empty State" to "First AI Breadcrumb" clear?
- **Task Hierarchy**: What are the most likely and important tasks? (e.g., Running a scan vs. Editing settings).

## Deliverables
- Markdown analysis document in `uppsrc/MaestroHub/UX_Analysis.md`.
