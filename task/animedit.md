43. Add small icon/thumbnail rendering for sprites based on texture data. ✅
44. Add category filter (character / environment / effect / other). ✅
45. Add text filter (search by name or ID). ✅
46. Implement drag & drop from Parts panel to canvas to create SpriteInstances. ✅
47. Add right‑click context menu for sprite operations (edit, duplicate, delete). ✅
48. Implement basic sprite creation wizard (ID, texture path, region, pivot). ✅
49. Integrate Image Layers / texture import with sprite creation pipeline. ✅
50. Add sprite metadata editor UI (category, tags, description). ✅
51. Implement sorting options (by name, by category, by recent use). ✅
52. Add error handling for dangling sprite IDs (removed sprite used by frames). ✅

### **v1.2 — Timeline (Animation Sequence Editing) (COMPLETED)**
53. Visualize animation frames as horizontal card list in Timeline panel. ✅
54. Show frame index, frame name, and a tiny thumbnail for each. ✅
55. Implement frame selection from Timeline (sync with active Frame in state). ✅
56. Implement drag‑to‑reorder frames within the selected Animation. ✅
57. Add "Insert Frame" button (create new frame and insert into timeline). ✅
58. Add "Add Existing Frame" button (choose from global frame list). ✅
59. Add frame duplication from timeline (copy references and/or instances). ✅
60. Implement frame duration slider inside each timeline card. ✅
61. Implement play/pause/stop controls for animation preview. ✅
62. Implement loop mode toggle for preview (loop vs play once). ✅
63. Implement preview playback based on durations (defaultDuration / overrides). ✅
64. Display current playback position as highlight on timeline. ✅
65. Implement onion‑skin (ghost frame) toggle and frame range (prev/next). ✅
66. Render onion skins in the canvas with configurable opacity. ✅
