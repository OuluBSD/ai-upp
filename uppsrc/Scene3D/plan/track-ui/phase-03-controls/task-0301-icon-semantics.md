# Task 0301 - Icon Semantics Mapping

## Goal
Replace placeholder ribbon icons with a proper semantic icon registry.

## Scope
- Map icon_semantics tokens to images.
- Provide fallback icons for missing semantics.
- Add style variants for small/large icons.

## Acceptance
- Ribbon icons match their semantics across all tabs.
- Missing icons degrade gracefully with a fallback.
