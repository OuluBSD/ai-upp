# Task 0901 - Mesh/Polygon Animation

## Goal
Enable animation of mesh vertices/polygons via keyframes and tools.

## Scope
- Store per-vertex or per-face animation data.
- Allow keyframing mesh deformations.
- Provide a basic mesh animation editor UI.

## Implementation Notes
- Start with per-vertex delta tracks (position offsets).
- Provide timeline hooks for animating topology changes (if supported).

## Success Criteria
- Mesh deformation can be keyframed and played back.
- Animations persist in save/load.

## Status
- Done
