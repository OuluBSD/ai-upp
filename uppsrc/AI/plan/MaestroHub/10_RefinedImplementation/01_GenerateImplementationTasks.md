# Task: Generate Implementation Tasks
# Status: DONE

## Objective
Convert the YAML mockup and research results into a set of actionable implementation tasks.

## Requirements
- Review `GUI_Mockup.yaml`.
- Create new task files in this phase for every significant UI change.
- Categorize tasks by "Core" (Maestro package changes) and "GUI" (MaestroHub package changes).
- Update `cookie.txt` to point to the first implementation task once generated.
