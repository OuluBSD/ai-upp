# Task: Persona-based Orchestration Playbooks
# Status: DONE

## Objective
Define "Runbooks of Runbooks" for specific user personas and their high-level goals.

## Scenarios
- **The Porter**: Strategy for moving large codebases (`repo` -> `convert` -> `work` -> `replay`).
- **The Quality Guardian**: Strategy for continuous monitoring (`ops` -> `log` -> `issues` -> `evidence`).
- **The Architect**: Strategy for rule design (`playbook` -> `runbook` -> `workflow`).

## Deliverables
- Scenario-based strategy guide in `uppsrc/MaestroHub/Persona_Playbooks.md`.
