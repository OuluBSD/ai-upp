Task 0001 - Coordinate spaces and transforms

Checklist
- List all spaces: camera-left/right, stereo-camera, IMU body, fusion/odom, map/world, UI view.
- Define handedness, axes orientation, and units.
- Define transform chain and ownership (who updates which transform).
- Decide whether ORB matching runs in image space only or a dedicated "feature space".

Deliverables
- A diagram and a short written spec for transforms and ownership.
