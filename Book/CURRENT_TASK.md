# Current Task — Book Chronicle (Session Handoff)

See: [AGENTS](./AGENTS.md)

Scope
- Volume I (Ultimate, upstream): continue drafting long-form chapters with references, plus paired summaries in Book/.
- Keep `.upp` manifests updated per AGENTS policy.

Completed This Session

  - I - Ultimate/005 - Tooling And Core Expansions.md (2008-08-17 to 2008-09-30)
  - I - Ultimate/006 - Assist And Editor Overhaul.md (2008-10-01 to 2008-10-31)

  - Book/Assist++ Refactor and Editor Overhaul.md
  - Book/Signals, Docking, and A++ Polish.md
- Updated manifests:
  - Book/I - Ultimate/I - Ultimate.upp: listed ../AGENTS.md first; added 006 and 007.
  - Book/II - Topside/II - Topside.upp: listed ../AGENTS.md first (polish).
  - Book/Book/Book.upp: validated usage of subpackages; will include ../CURRENT_TASK.md (see below).
- Updated Book/AGENTS.md with `.upp` rules and Session Handoff guidelines.

Next Steps (When You Say “continue”)
1) Draft I - Ultimate/008 for 2008-12 (scan git log 2008-12-01..2008-12-31).
2) Create paired summary in Book/ with matching Date Span.
3) Update I - Ultimate.upp file list, maintaining numeric order.
4) Optional backfill: add summaries for 001–004 for consistency.

Method Notes
- Use `git log --since=YYYY-MM-DD --until=YYYY-MM-DD --pretty='...' --reverse` to map commits into narrative themes.
- Preserve author names; keep references as “SHA — subject (Author, Date)”.
- Keep chapter titles concise, with visible Date Span near the top.
- Pair every long-form chapter with a compact summary under Book/.

Open Questions
- Do we want summaries for earlier chapters (001–004) in this pass or defer?
- Any special emphasis areas (e.g., RichEdit deep dive) for December 2008?
