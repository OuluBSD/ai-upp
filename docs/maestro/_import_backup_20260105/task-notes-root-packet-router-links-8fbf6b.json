    "  # Packet Router \u2013 Link & Customer Inventory",
    "  This note captures where loop-era constructs (Customers, Link factories, and side-link plumbing) live today. It is the seed list for Phase\u202f0 discovery so we know exactly what needs to be untangled before dropping routers in.",
    "  ## CustomerBase Touch Points",
    "  - **Core implementation:** `uppsrc/Eon/Core/Base.h` and `Base.cpp` define `CustomerBase`, provide loop-queue helpers (`EnsureAudioDefaultQueue`, `Recv/Send`, `ForwardPacket`), and expose the lifecycle hooks that all customer atoms inherit.",
    "  - **ChainContext usage:** `uppsrc/Eon/Core/Context.cpp:414` dynamically casts atoms to `CustomerBase` during `ChainContext::PostInitializeAll()` to apply queue sizing rules per loop.",
    "  - **Script guidance:** `uppsrc/Eon/Core/AGENTS.md:157` documents loop priming behavior and the default queue size bump performed for audio customers."
