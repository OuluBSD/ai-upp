Task 0004 - Descriptor matching acceleration

Checklist
- Evaluate SIMD popcount Hamming for small sets.
- Define bucket/hash strategy for medium/large sets (LSH or multi-index hashing).
- Decide if octree is used only for spatial queries vs descriptor queries.

Deliverables
- Matching strategy spec and performance targets.
