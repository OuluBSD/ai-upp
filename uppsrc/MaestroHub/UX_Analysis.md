### User Needs
1. **Fleet Management**: See status of multiple projects and active AI sessions at a glance.
2. **Batch Processing**: Ability to run scans or triages across several modules simultaneously.
3. **Template Management**: Easily design and verify a Runbook once, then deploy it automatically.
4. **Reliability Monitoring**: High-density logs and audit trails for automated AI actions.

## Likely & Important Tasks
1. **Workflow Dispatch**: Selecting a Runbook and applying it to a project/issue.
