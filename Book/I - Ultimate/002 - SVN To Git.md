# SVN To Git — Migration Begins (2008-06)
**Date Span:** 2008-06-07 to 2008-06-12

In early June 2008, **mdelfede** reshaped the repository, changing the old **Subversion** layout to prepare for a new cadence. On 2008-06-07, the first markers read “changed svn layout,” accompanied by fresh **uvs2 releases** bundling uppsrc, tutorial, examples, and reference snapshots. The next day followed with a trio of “modified linux build scripts,” the hands-on work of aligning **build infrastructure** with the transition. By 2008-06-10, more releases landed, indicating a steady rhythm of packaging while infrastructure settled.

Alongside, **mrjtuk** focused on developer experience: a TabBar ScrollBar autohide fix, compatibility touches to “work with latest release,” and a Docking improvement adding “another animation option” (2008-06-11 to 2008-06-12). Meanwhile, releases continued to tick forward, smoothing edges as the toolchain and packaging matured.
