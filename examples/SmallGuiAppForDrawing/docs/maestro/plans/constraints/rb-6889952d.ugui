I will read the content of the specified runbook file to identify its goals and steps for deriving formal logic constraints.
I will read `docs/maestro/runbooks/items/rb-drawing-pencil-red-save.json` to see if it contains relevant steps for deriving constraints, as the provided runbook was empty.
I will read `docs/maestro/plans/constraints/rb-6889952d.ugui` to check for existing constraints that might clarify the intended content of the empty runbook.
I will read `docs/maestro/runbooks/items/rb-ffffffffdd2aa07f.json` to see if it provides any additional context or patterns for deriving constraints.
I will read `main.cpp` to verify the actual control names and UI structure, ensuring the derived constraints are accurate.
I will read `docs/maestro/plans/constraints/rb-drawing-pencil-red-save.ugui` to compare its content with the other constraints and ensure I provide the most appropriate set.
I will read `docs/maestro/runbooks/items/rb-drawing-app-pencil-color-save.json` to see if it contains any additional details that should be reflected in the constraints.
I will read `docs/maestro/runbooks/items/rb-drawing-app-core-features.json` to see if it contains any other core features that should be included in the constraints.
