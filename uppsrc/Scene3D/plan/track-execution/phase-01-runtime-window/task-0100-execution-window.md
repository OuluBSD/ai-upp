# Task 0100 - Execution Window

## Goal
Add an execution-mode window that renders and runs compiled projects.

## Scope
- Execution is distinct from ModelerApp Play/Pause, but shares scripts and scene graph.
- Execution window loads compiled project files and runs ByteVM scripts.
- Support running in ModelerApp and in a standalone executor app.

## Success Criteria
- Execution window opens and renders the compiled project.
- ByteVM scripts run on start and update correctly.
- Execution mode can be triggered from ModelerApp UI.

## Status
- Done
