Phase 00 - Foundations

Goals
- Robust timestamping and data structures.
- Calibration storage and loading.
- Basic visualizer for raw streams.

Status
- [x] Monotonic usecs timestamping for all sensor data.
- [x] Geometry-level interfaces for Tracking, IMU, and Fusion.
- [x] RecyclerPool and BiVectorRecycler for high-perf buffer management.
- [x] .stcal format standardized and integrated.

Exit Criteria
- Application starts, captures frames, and allows calibration loading.
