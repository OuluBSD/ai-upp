# Early Preamble And Charter

Date Span: (ongoing)

This file preserves the initial Book intent and format decisions made at the start of the fork, merged here to keep Topsideâ€™s chronicle in one place.

## Orientation (from initial Book)
- Summary of goals and scope for documenting development.

## Chronicle Charter
- Compact chapters; use inline references; prefer long scrollable files over many tiny ones.

## Format Shift
- Moved to two-volume layout (I: Ultimate, II: Topside) with Roman numerals.
