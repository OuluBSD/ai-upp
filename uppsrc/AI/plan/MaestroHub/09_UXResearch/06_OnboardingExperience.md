# Task: Onboarding Experience
# Status: TODO

## Objective
Analyze the "Time to Value" for a user who has never used Maestro.

## Research Questions
- **Zero State**: What does the Dashboard show when no project is loaded? Does it guide the user to `init`?
- **Guided Tour**: Should the first `init` trigger a "Welcome" tutorial?
- **Documentation**: Is help contextual? (e.g., clicking a "?" icon next to "TU Browser" explains what a TU is).

## Deliverables
- Onboarding checklist and UI recommendations in `uppsrc/MaestroHub/Onboarding_Plan.md`.
