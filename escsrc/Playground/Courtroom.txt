Notes:
- purpose: to simulate resolving of an issue using the classic US jury system case (to be studied later)
- internals:
	- jury selection is important when used as a personal exploration tool
		- this might reveal something about yourself, that you never really thought about
- usage examples:
	- make short reel videos based on AI courtroom discussions
