# Persona-based Orchestration Playbooks

## 1. The Porter
**Goal**: Move a massive legacy codebase to a modern framework (e.g., U++).
**Strategy**: `repo` -> `tu` -> `runbook` -> `convert` -> `replay`.

| Step | Action | Feature | Outcome |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | Structural Discovery | `repo scan` | Identified all 50 packages and circular deps. |
| 2 | Symbol Indexing | `tu build` | Cached AST for atomic refactors. |
| 3 | Migration Design | `runbook resolve` | Generated "String Migration" blueprint. |
| 4 | Batch Execution | `convert run` | 500 files refactored autonomously overnight. |
| 5 | Integrity Proof | `convert replay` | Verified zero regressions in logic. |

## 2. The Quality Guardian
**Goal**: Continuous observability and automated triage of technical debt.
**Strategy**: `ops` -> `log` -> `issues` -> `solutions`.

| Step | Action | Feature | Outcome |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | Health Check | `ops doctor` | Verified environment parity. |
| 2 | Finding Extraction | `log scan` | Parsed 200 warnings from CI logs. |
| 3 | Auto-Triage | `issues triage` | Grouped 50 "Null-Check" bugs via AI. |
| 4 | Pattern Match | `solutions` | Applied "Check Pointer Before Use" pattern to 30 files. |
| 5 | Evidence Pack | `evidence collect` | Generated audit trail for security review. |

## 3. The Architect
**Goal**: Design complex AI-automated systems from narrative ideas.
**Strategy**: `runbook` -> `workflow` -> `ops simulation`.

| Step | Action | Feature | Outcome |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | Narrative Intake | `runbook add` | Recorded "Linux VR 6DOF Pipeline" ideas. |
| 2 | Logic Synthesis | `workflow synthesis` | AI converted narrative to formal state graph. |
| 3 | Policy Steering | `workflow visualize` | Manually resolved state transition conflicts. |
| 4 | Execution Sim | `ops simulation` | Verified protocol coherence before implement. |
| 5 | Knowledge Hub | `tutorial` | Published project-specific onboarding for new AI agents. |
