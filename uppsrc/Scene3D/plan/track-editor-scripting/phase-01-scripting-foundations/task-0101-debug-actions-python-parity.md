# Task 0101 - Debug Actions Python Parity

## Goal
Ensure all Debug->Pointcloud actions have Python-callable equivalents and match UI behavior.

## Scope
- Verify parity for all debug actions (generate, simulate, localize, controller steps, clear).
- Ensure Python calls work for headless and GUI sessions.
- Document API usage in a small script example.

## Success Criteria
- All Debug->Pointcloud actions are callable from Python.
- Results match UI commands.

## Status
- Done (2026-02-05)
  - Added example script in `share/py/examples/modeler_pointcloud_debug.py`.
