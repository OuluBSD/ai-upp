# Task 0100 - Create Operations

## Goal
Bind Create tab actions to real object creation flows.

## Scope
- Primitive generation (cube/sphere/cylinder/cone/plane).
- Camera, lights, skybox, particle system, and 2D overlay items.
- Import static/animated mesh from assets.

## Acceptance
- Each Create tab button spawns the expected node in the scene tree.
- Created nodes appear in the viewport and can be selected.
