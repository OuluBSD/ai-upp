# Assist++ Refactor and Editor Overhaul
**Date Span:** 2008-10-01 to 2008-10-31

Massive C++ parser and Assist++ refactors shipped a new TheIDE code browser, better navigator scope search, and THISBACK support. Editor polish spanned RichEdit styling, syntax highlighting, left-bar fixes, GLX/GLCtrl stability, and tooltip behavior. Tooling and UI saw OLEDB `GetInsertedId`, TreeCtrl/display/API tweaks, layout wizard naming, and T++ annotations and click-to-document improvements.
