Internals:
	File-system based:
		- start from "inspiration seed"
			- convert it to structured inspirational mind-map
				- make leafs as "punchlines" (only the punchline, nothing else, no story before punchline (make it later))
		- find best relational path between "punchlines"
			- analyse how the different paths feels for listener
	Structured text based:
		- pick "punchlines" & make them rhyme
		- make story before punchlines
			- A* route search: generate filler phrases before punchlines (or move punchline to beginning of the sentence etc.)
		- use given heuristical scoring attributes from the user to pick the best route
