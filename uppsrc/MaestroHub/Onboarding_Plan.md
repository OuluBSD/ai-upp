# Onboarding Experience Plan

## Goal: First AI Action in < 60 seconds

## 1. Zero State
- If `current_root` is empty: Show a "Welcome" splash with "Open Directory" and "New Project" buttons.
- If not initialized: Show a persistent high-priority notification bar.

## 2. The "Hello Maestro" Tutorial
- A one-page interactive walkthrough showing:
  - Where the AI chat lives.
  - How to run a scan.
  - How to interpret the Plan tree.

## 3. Tooltips & Help
- Add tooltips to all icon-only buttons.
- Link "F1" to a searchable "Maestro Playbook" reference.
