# Task: User Flows & Scenarios
# Status: DONE

## Objective
Map out the step-by-step journeys for common high-value tasks.

## Research Questions
- **The "Fix-It" Loop**: User finds a bug in Log Analyzer -> Creates Issue -> Triages -> AI Fixes -> User Verifies. How many clicks? Where is the friction?
- **The "Discovery" Flow**: User opens a new repo -> Needs to understand dependencies. Is the TU Browser reachable and intuitive?
- **Context Switching**: How easily can a user jump from a Work Session back to the Issue tracker without losing state?

## Deliverables
- User flow diagrams or descriptions in `uppsrc/MaestroHub/User_Flows.md`.
