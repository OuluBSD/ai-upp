# Task: System Lifecycle Analysis
# Status: DONE

## Objective
Analyze the lifecycle of core entities (Project, Issue, Work Session, Runbook).

## Research Questions
- **Project States**: Discovered -> Initialized -> Monitored -> Archived.
- **Issue States**: Open -> Analyzed -> In-Work -> Verified -> Closed.
- **Runbook States**: Draft -> Verified -> Library (Reusable) -> Deprecated.
- **Work Session States**: Active -> Paused -> Branched (Subwork) -> Finalized.

## Deliverables
- Lifecycle state diagrams or tables in `uppsrc/MaestroHub/Lifecycle_States.md`.
