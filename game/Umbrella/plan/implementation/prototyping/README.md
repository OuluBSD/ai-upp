This directory contains prototyping tasks for converting RainbowGame from libGDX to U++.

## Shell Commands to Explore RainbowGame

```bash
find /common/active/sblo/Dev/RainbowGame/trash/core/src/main/java -name "*.java"
head -20 /common/active/sblo/Dev/RainbowGame/trash/core/src/main/java/com/rainbowgame/editor/MapEditorScreen.java
```

## Task Overview

- `task9/MapEditorScreen_XML_GUI_Creation.md` - Creating XML GUI design for MapEditorScreen
- `task10/MapEditorScreen_Widget_Mapping.md` - Mapping XML GUI to U++ widgets

## Focus

These tasks specifically address the complex MapEditorScreen.java conversion through multiple phases:
1. XML GUI design
2. Widget mapping
3. Implementation (covered in development phase)

This phased approach addresses the complexity of the MapEditorScreen which was noted as "quite too large to handle at once".
