# Task 0401 - Debug Actions Python Parity

## Goal
Ensure all Debug->Pointcloud actions have Python-callable equivalents and match UI behavior.

- Ensure Python calls work for headless and GUI sessions.
- Document API usage in a small script example.

## Success Criteria
- All Debug->Pointcloud actions are callable from Python.
- Results match UI commands.
