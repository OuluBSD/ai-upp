# Task: Functional Interconnection Map
# Status: DONE

## Objective
Research and document how different Maestro features/commands connect and share data.

## Research Questions
- **Data Lineage**: How does a finding from `log scan` become a Maestro `issue`? 
- **Context Propagation**: How does `work start` inherit context from a `runbook` or `issue`?
- **Audit Trail**: Where does `evidence` collection fit into the active `work` cycle?
- **Feedback Loops**: How does a `regression-replay` failure loop back into the `issue` tracker?

## Deliverables
- Markdown document in `uppsrc/MaestroHub/Functional_Map.md` showing the "Runbook of Features".
