# Task 0800 - 2D Drawing as 3D Objects

## Goal
Add 2D drawing tools that create 3D-rendered objects (e.g., billboarded or planar geometry).

## Scope
- 2D pen/shape tools: line, rectangle, circle, polygon.
- Generate geometry on a plane or in a 2D layer rendered in 3D.
- Edit/erase tools for 2D shapes.

## Implementation Notes
- Use a 2D graphics component that outputs mesh primitives.
- Maintain a 2D layer transform (for placement in 3D).

## Success Criteria
- User can draw 2D shapes and see them rendered in the 3D viewport.
- Shapes are editable and persist on save/load.

## Status
- Pending
