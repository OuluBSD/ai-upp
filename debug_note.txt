After extensive analysis of the FboAtomT and X11SwGfx implementation, I believe the white screen issue occurs because:

1. The X11SwFboBase (FboAtomT<X11SwGfx>) renders to its own internal framebuffer
2. The X11SwVideoAtomPipe expects to display content but may not be getting the rendered output from the FBO
3. The connection between FBO program and video pipe may not be properly established in terms of data flow

The issue likely stems from the fact that the FBO program atom renders a scene but doesn't properly pass the rendered output to the video pipe atom for display.
