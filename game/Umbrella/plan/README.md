# Umbrella Game Project - Planning Structure

This directory contains the planning documents for converting the RainbowGame/libGDX project to a U++-based game framework.

## Structure

The planning follows a track/phase/task hierarchy:

- **Tracks**: Major work areas (Analysis, Design, Implementation, Testing, Deployment)
- **Phases**: Sequential stages within each track (Discovery, Planning, Development, etc.)
- **Tasks**: Individual work items with specific deliverables

## Current Status

Initial planning phase complete. The following planning documents have been created:

### Analysis Track
- `analysis/discovery/task1/README.md` - Initial project analysis
- `analysis/discovery/task2/Build_Outputs_Analysis.md` - Build outputs analysis

### Design Track  
- `design/planning/task1/MapEditorScreen_Conversion_Plan.md` - MapEditorScreen conversion plan
- `design/planning/task3/LibGDX_to_Upp_Conversion_Strategy.md` - Conversion strategy

### Implementation Track
- `implementation/development/task1/Java_Files_Conversion_Plan.md` - Java files conversion plan

### Master Documents
- `Master_Plan.md` - Overall project plan
- `cookie.txt` - Progress tracking

## Next Steps

1. Begin implementation of infrastructure components
2. Start conversion of core utilities
3. Implement basic graphics system
4. Proceed with UI framework conversion
5. Tackle MapEditorScreen conversion as a pilot project

## Reference

For the original requirements, see the parent project documentation regarding the conversion of RainbowGame from libGDX to U++, with special focus on MapEditorScreen.java and the replacement of libGDX dependencies with U++ equivalents.
