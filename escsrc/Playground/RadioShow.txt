					but refuses to address the other party's arguments about the strategy for pursuing that party's agenda.
				 3. A scientific progressivist who supports all progressivism that involves

				 4. A representative of a species of animal who agrees to talk only about the domination of lower species 
					and lower internal classes, but not about the existence of animals dominating over his species.
