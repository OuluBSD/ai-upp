# AI-Log
Talking to AI is sometimes an art. We'll add here texts that were written by hand and that have made changes to the code. You don't have to include everything.




#### 14.9.2025 by Seppo Pakonen:
Add to "/AGENTS.md" that ".cpp", ".icpp" and ".c" files of a package (with .upp file) must try to include only the mainheader of the package relatively '#include "PackageName.h"'. The reason is that we use custom header pre compilation, which is not too smart and that helps a lot. It's the U++'s BLITZ. Other includes can be added after that if the implementation needs to forward-include something from later packages (in dependency queue). So every package must also have that "PackageName.h" header, and that's always the main header which includes all other headers in the package, and it shouldn't have much else for clarity (but there's some exceptions for small packages etc.). This is very important. Also we prefer, that other than the main header doesn't have namespace in them, but the main header includes them inside "namespace Upp" scope which is made using NAMESPACE_UPP macro. We avoid clutter in that way, and BLITZ works slightly better too. This is like a "no-exceptions" pattern, which AI easily doesn't do correctly, because other c++ projects and conventions doesn't have this. Also, if you have subpackages like "AI", "AI/Core", "AI/Core/Core"; then subpackages are always independent packages, and not somehow gathered in parent-package (like .h files aren't somehow cross-included). Parent package may include only the main header of sub-package. Sub-packages must chain them correctly including previous sub-package or other packages (without circular dependency). Most likely, sub-package shouldn't include parent package, but it can be other way around, if sub-package really is an extension to the parent-package.
