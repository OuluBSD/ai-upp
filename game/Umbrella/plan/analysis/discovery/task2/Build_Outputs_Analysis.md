# Build Outputs Analysis

## Overview
Analyze the RainbowGame build process and outputs to understand what files are generated by `./gradlew desktop:build`.

## Build Process
- Build script: `/common/active/sblo/Dev/RainbowGame/trash/build.sh`
- Command: `./gradlew desktop:build`
- This uses Gradle to build the desktop application

## Expected Build Outputs
Based on the directory structure found, the build generates:

### Desktop Build Artifacts
- `/common/active/sblo/Dev/RainbowGame/trash/desktop/build/libs/desktop.jar` - Main executable JAR
- `/common/active/sblo/Dev/RainbowGame/trash/desktop/build/distributions/desktop.tar` - Tar distribution
- `/common/active/sblo/Dev/RainbowGame/trash/desktop/build/distributions/desktop.zip` - Zip distribution
- `/common/active/sblo/Dev/RainbowGame/trash/desktop/build/scripts/desktop` - Unix startup script
- `/common/active/sblo/Dev/RainbowGame/trash/desktop/build/scripts/desktop.bat` - Windows startup script

### Compiled Classes
- `/common/active/sblo/Dev/RainbowGame/trash/desktop/build/classes/java/main/` - Compiled desktop launcher classes
- `/common/active/sblo/Dev/RainbowGame/trash/core/build/classes/java/main/` - Compiled core game classes

### Resources
- `/common/active/sblo/Dev/RainbowGame/trash/core/build/resources/main/` - Game resources (atlases, audio, levels, etc.)

## Integration with Umbrella Project
The U++ conversion will need to replicate the functionality of these build outputs:
- The desktop.jar equivalent will be a native U++ executable
- Resource management will be handled through U++'s resource system
- Distribution packages will be created using U++ build tools

## Action Items
1. Identify all critical files from the build output that need to be replicated in U++
2. Plan the U++ equivalent build process
3. Map resource loading mechanisms from libGDX to U++
