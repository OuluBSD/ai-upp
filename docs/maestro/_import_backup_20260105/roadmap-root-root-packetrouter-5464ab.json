    "  # Packet Router Migration Roadmap",
    "  **Goal:** Replace the loop-centric Eon dataflow runtime with a router-based architecture where Atoms expose explicit ports and all packet movement is mediated by a PacketRouter rather than Link chains.",
    "  ---",
    "  ## Context & Targets",
    "  - **Task thread:** `task/PacketRouter.md` \u2014 convert loop-based Eon graphs into router-managed networks.",
    "  - **Primary motivator:** Side links, customers, and loop balancing no longer match how we want packet flow to work. We need uniform, nameable ports, router-managed flow control, and more flexible network topology."
