Purpose:
	- ai generates gui program on-demand and simulates the state of the system
Internals:
	- add User and System spaces (+ AgentInteractionSession + Entity(Agent))
	- Agent: esc scripts, which call stages
		- need ecs ctrl: AgentCtrl (so you can set esc script and stage etc.)
	- user starts this UserAndSystem demo from button SO
		- some dynamic gui, created with esc script?
			- check bazaar project for dynamic gui (maybe it was scripted already!?!?)
			- there is also a dynamic gui-ctrl updater, which works with esc script...
