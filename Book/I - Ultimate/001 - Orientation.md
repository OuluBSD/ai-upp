# I — Ultimate (Upstream) — Orientation

### Scope
This directory chronicles the upstream Ultimate project. Content here is an approximation until upstream history is merged; guessed eras are marked (guess). Author names will follow upstream logs once available.

Date Span: 2008-06-07 to (ongoing)

### Prelude (guess)
- Genesis of U++ Core and BLITZ include policy; package architecture crystallizes.
- Framework expansion across Geometry, ComputerVision, Sound, Form; editors emerge.
- TheIDE matures, adding control planes, meta tools, and VFS abstractions.

### Imported Influences Noted in Fork
- Package restructuring and Draw2 split patterns [1][2][3].
- VFS and Core relocations [4][5].
