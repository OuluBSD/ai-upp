# Task 0301 - Frustum Visibility Rules

## Goal
Make frustum visualization consistent with tree focus/active state and visibility toggles.

## Scope
- Frustum should draw for the active/focused camera only.
- Visibility toggles should hide frustum alongside the object.
- Program/focus camera visibility should follow tree toggles.

## Success Criteria
- Only the selected camera draws a frustum.
- Toggling visibility hides both camera and frustum.

## Status
- Pending
