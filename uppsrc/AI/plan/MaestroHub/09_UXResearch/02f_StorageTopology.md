# Task: Storage Topology & Migration UI
# Status: DONE

## Objective
Design the UI for managing project storage layouts and mechanical conversions.

## Requirements
- **Layout Selection**: Wizard or Settings UI to choose between `docs/maestro/`, `.maestro/`, or distributed models.
- **Migration Dashboard**: A "Mechanical Converter" UI that shows migration progress between storage modes with deterministic validation.
- **Isolation Management**: UI to define subdirectory boundaries for monorepo isolation.

## Deliverables
- UI Mockups for Storage Management in `uppsrc/MaestroHub/Storage_UI_Design.md`.
