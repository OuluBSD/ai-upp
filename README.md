## Introduction

U++ is a C++ cross-platform rapid application development framework focused on programmers productivity. It includes a set of libraries (GUI, SQL, Network, etc.), with an integrated development environment.

Rapid development is achieved by the [smart and aggressive use of C++](https://www.ultimatepp.org/www$uppweb$overview$en-us.html) rather than through fancy code generators. In this respect, U++ competes with popular scripting languages while preserving C/C++ runtime characteristics.

The U++ integrated development environment, TheIDE, introduces modular concepts to C++ programming. It features BLITZ-build technology to speedup C++ rebuilds by up to 4 times, Visual designers for U++ libraries, [Topic++](https://www.ultimatepp.org/app$ide$Topic$en-us.html) for documenting code and creating rich text resources for the applications (code documentation and examples) and [Assist++](https://www.ultimatepp.org/app$ide$Assist$en-us.html) - a powerful C++ code analyzer that provides features like code completion, abbreviation, navigation and conversion.

TheIDE can work with GCC, Clang, MinGW and Visual C++ while containing a fully featured debugger. It can also be used for developing non-U++ applications.

U++ supports following platforms on the production level: **Windows**, **macOS**, **GNU/Linux** & **FreeBSD**.

## What you can get with U++?

* Out of the box C++ libraries for cross-platform GUI development
* Fully featured IDE designed to develop complex and high performance applications.

It can be used for any work of your needs.

### Books

If you are looking for books about the U++ framework, here is a list of books we recommend:
- [**Getting started with the U++ Framework**](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CQHX84VZ/) - the book written by Frederik Dumarey and reviewed by the main authors of U++. It is an excellent starting point for anyone new to the framework. Also, if you are an experienced U++ developer, you will find much valuable content, including a deep dive into Skylark (web framework) and Turtle (HTML, JS client).

## Extensibility

The functionality of the U++ framework can be easily extended by third-party packages. We introduced the concept of a global registry of repositories that can be downloaded and directly used in the project. To learn more about this technology, please visit [UppHub](https://github.com/ultimatepp/UppHub) repository.

UppHub conceptually is very similar to the package manager concept known from other technologies, and in big generalization, it can be called like that.

## Repository

### Repository layout

The U++ repository is divided into several directories. Some of them are:
* **autotest** - unit and integration tests for our framework
* **examples** - exemplary codes of complex applications
* **references** - reference examples demonstrating individual features of U++
* **tutorial** - exemplary code from our tutorials
* **uppsrc** - main sources of the framework
* **benchmarks** - code for benchmarking purposes
* **rainbow** - area for new GUI backends development
* **upptst** - manual testing code for the framework

## Telemetry & Analytics v1

The system now supports a comprehensive telemetry and analytics layer that enables external AI agents to gain situational awareness of the workspace. This provides rich introspection capabilities through structured JSON APIs.

### Available Telemetry Commands:

* **workspace_stats** - Provides structural analytics about the entire workspace
  * Number of packages
  * Total source files and distribution by extension
  * Average file size and largest file information
  * Main package name (if set)

* **package_stats** - Delivers detailed metrics about a specific package
  * Number of files and uses-count
  * Include count and total lines of code
  * Histogram of file sizes

* **file_complexity** - Computes complexity heuristics for a specific source file
  * Lines of code and estimated function count
  * Number of includes and nesting depth
  * Comment ratio

* **graph_stats** - Analyzes the dependency graph structure
  * Node and edge counts
  * Average outdegree and cycle detection
  * Longest dependency chain length
  * Most depended-on package identification

* **edit_history** - Tracks changes during the session
  * Records per-file size deltas
  * Timestamped edit history

### JSON Output Examples:

**workspace_stats:**
```json
{
  "packages": 4,
  "files": 132,
  "extensions": { "cpp": 84, "h": 48 },
  "largest_file": { "path": "src/Engine.cpp", "bytes": 42103 },
  "average_size": 3370,
  "main_package": "MyApp"
}
```

**file_complexity:**
```json
{
  "lines": 230,
  "functions": 7,
  "includes": 5,
  "nesting": 12,
  "comment_ratio": 0.18
}
```

**graph_stats:**
```json
{
  "nodes": 4,
  "edges": 3,
  "avg_out": 0.75,
  "cycles": false,
  "max_chain": 3,
  "most_depended_on": "Core"
}
```

This subsystem enables external AI to make **strategic decisions** by providing visibility into workspace health, change impact, code complexity, and quality signals.

## Optimization Loop v1

The system includes an iterative optimization subsystem that enables automated structural cleanup and refactoring of code packages. This provides a foundation for AI-driven refactoring through repeated incremental improvements with measurable outcomes.

### Core Features:

* **Iterative Refactoring** - Runs a sequence of optimizations repeatedly on a package
* **Telemetry-Based Scoring** - Uses heuristic metrics to evaluate improvement between iterations
* **Convergence Detection** - Stops automatically when improvements plateau or diminish
* **Regression Prevention** - Can halt when metrics indicate degradation
* **Built-in Refactoring Actions** - Currently includes operations like dead include removal and include canonicalization

### Available Optimization Command:

* **optimize_package** - Performs iterative structural cleanup on a specified package
  * Configurable maximum iterations
  * Convergence threshold for automatic termination
  * Options to stop on metric degradation
  * Detailed iteration history in JSON output

### Command Example:

```bash
theide-cli --workspace-root . --json optimize_package \
  --name MyApp \
  --max_iterations 10 \
  --converge_threshold 0.05
```

### JSON Output Example:

```json
{
  "iterations": [
    {
      "index": 0,
      "score_delta": -2.5,
      "changes": { "removed_includes": 4 }
    },
    {
      "index": 1,
      "score_delta": -0.8,
      "changes": { "removed_includes": 2 }
    }
  ],
  "reason": "converged",
  "success": true
}
```

This subsystem enables external AI to perform **systematic structural improvements** by automatically iterating over code with measurable quality heuristics to guide the process.

## AI Supervisor Layer v1

The system includes an AI Supervisor Layer that generates strategic, multi-step improvement plans for code packages. This component consumes telemetry, graph statistics, and complexity metrics to produce actionable recommendations for workspace enhancement.

### Core Features:

* **Strategic Planning** - Generates a multi-step plan with prioritized recommendations
* **Telemetry Integration** - Consumes workspace stats, package metrics, and complexity data
* **Heuristic Decision Making** - Uses rule-based algorithms to identify optimization opportunities
* **Structured Output** - Returns JSON describing recommended actions, parameters, and reasoning
* **AI Agent Ready** - Designed specifically for AI agents to use for autonomous project improvement

### Available Supervisor Command:

* **get_optimization_plan** - Analyzes a package and generates an AI-guided improvement plan
  * Identifies unused includes for cleanup
  * Detects symbol renaming opportunities
  * Flags graph simplification possibilities
  * Recommends optimization loop execution
  * Provides risk scoring based on complexity metrics

### Command Example:

```bash
theide-cli --workspace-root . --json get_optimization_plan --name MyApp
```

### JSON Output Example:

```json
{
  "steps": [
    {
      "action": "run_playbook",
      "target": "cleanup_includes_and_rebuild",
      "params": { "package": "MyApp" },
      "reason": "Many unused #includes detected."
    },
    {
      "action": "optimize_package",
      "params": { "name": "MyApp", "max_iterations": 5 },
      "reason": "High complexity score & long dependency chains."
    }
  ],
  "summary": "Package 'MyApp' shows structural issues: Risk score 0.72"
}
```

This subsystem enables external AI to make **strategic decisions** by providing a planning layer that interprets workspace telemetry and recommends specific improvement actions.
