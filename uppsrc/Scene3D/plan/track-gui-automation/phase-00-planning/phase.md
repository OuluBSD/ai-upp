# Phase 00 - Planning (GUI Automation)

Goal: define the ModelerApp GUI automation test strategy, directory layout, and baseline coverage map.

Focus:
- Decide test naming + grouping conventions.
- Confirm how tests run (CLI flags, exit codes, report output).
- List baseline UI features to cover with ByteVM automation scripts.
