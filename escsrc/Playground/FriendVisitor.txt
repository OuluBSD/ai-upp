Notes:
- purpose:
	use this to review your own home and how different people view it
- notes:
	I'm really curious about this myself. My own friends are too biased to rate this
	apartment, and don't give honest feedback, or even try to represent the general public.
	Besides, I have a sexier group of people in mind, for whom I would like to film my
	apartment on YouTube.
- internals:
	Map your home's architecture, items, paintings, furniture, etc. into the program's memory.
	Let different types of people visit your apartment.
	Let different types of people change your apartment "for the better" and create a feedback loop for yourself where you evaluate the changes.
- usage examples:
	Improve your home with it
	Make short video reels of your home
