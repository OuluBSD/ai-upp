A classic “Hello World” for STRIPS‐style planners is the Blocks World.  It’s simple, yet shows off pre- and post-conditions nicely.

Setting:
• You have three blocks (A, B, C) and a table.
• A “robot hand” can pick up and put down blocks, stack one on another, or unstack.

Atoms (attributes) you’ll need:

    on(X,Y) – block X is sitting directly on block Y
    on_table(X) – block X is directly on the table
    clear(X) – nothing is on top of X
    holding(X) – the robot hand is holding X
    handempty – the robot hand holds nothing

Actions:

    PickUp(X)
    • Pre: on_table(X), clear(X), handempty
    • Post: ¬on_table(X), ¬clear(X), ¬handempty, holding(X)

    PutDown(X)
    • Pre: holding(X)
    • Post: on_table(X), clear(X), handempty, ¬holding(X)

    Stack(X,Y)
    • Pre: holding(X), clear(Y)
    • Post: on(X,Y), clear(X), handempty, ¬holding(X), ¬clear(Y)

    Unstack(X,Y)
    • Pre: on(X,Y), clear(X), handempty
    • Post: holding(X), clear(Y), ¬on(X,Y), ¬clear(X), ¬handempty

Sample start state:
on_table(A), on_table(B), on_table(C),
clear(A), clear(B), clear(C),
handempty

Goal state (for example):
on(A,B), on(B,C)   (i.e. A on B on C)

Story to tie it together:
“Your robot’s job is to build a tower of three blocks.  At first all blocks lie separately on the table and the hand is empty.  The plan must pick up block B, stack it on C, then pick up A and stack it on B.”

This little scenario is the archetype “action‐planning 101”—you get to see how preconditions must be met before each move, and how each action transforms the world.
