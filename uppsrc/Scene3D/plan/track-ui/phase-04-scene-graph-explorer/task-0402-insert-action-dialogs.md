# Task 0402 - Insert Action Dialogs

## Goal
Implement insert action dialogs and behaviors described in scene_graph_explorer.xml.

## Scope
- Dialogs for cube/sphere/cylinder/cone/plane/camera/terrain/room/water.
- File dialogs for static/animated mesh import.
- Direct-create behaviors (lights, skybox, particles, overlays, etc.).
- Context-dependent creation for path nodes.

## Acceptance
- Each insert action matches dialog fields and default values.
- Creation integrates with current scene graph and properties.
- Direct-create actions do not prompt unnecessarily.
