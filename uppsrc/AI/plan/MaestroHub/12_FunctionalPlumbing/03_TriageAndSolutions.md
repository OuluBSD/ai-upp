# Task: Intelligence, Triage & Pattern Solutions

# Status: TODO

# Description
Close the loop between log findings and AI remediation using regex-based pattern matching.

# Objectives
- Implement regex-based error matching in `Log Analyzer`.
- Map regex groups to placeholders: `%FILEPATH%`, `%FILELINE%`, `%ERRORMESSAGE%`.
- Create the `Solutions Hub` (Pane or Dialog) to manage the pattern registry.
- Implement "AI Remediate" button: sends the matched error context to AI for a targeted fix proposal.

# UI Requirements
- High-density list for the pattern registry.
- Regex tester in the Solutions editor.
