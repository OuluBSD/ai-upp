# Task: Multi-Agent Simulation

# Status: TODO

# Description
Enhance the `MaestroAssistant` to visualize multi-agent collaboration and simulation traces.

# Objectives
- [ ] Extend `AIChatCtrl` to support "Agent Personas" (e.g., Architect, Coder, Reviewer).
- [ ] Implement color-coded message bubbles or headers per agent.
- [ ] Add a "Simulation Mode" toggle that shows internal agent-to-agent deliberation.
- [ ] Integrate with the "Maestro Pipeline" to show which agent is performing each stage.

# Requirements
- Visual distinction between user, system, and multiple AI agents.
- Support for "Hidden" internal thoughts vs. "Final" output.
- Align with the WinXP / professional engineer aesthetic.
