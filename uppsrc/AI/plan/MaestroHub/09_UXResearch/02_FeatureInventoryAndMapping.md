# Task: Feature Inventory & Mapping
# Status: DONE

## Objective
Catalog every feature in MaestroHub and MaestroCLI to ensure nothing is missed in the new design.

## Requirements
- List all CLI subcommands (`init`, `repo`, `plan`, `tu`, `log`, etc.).
- List all current GUI components and their functions.
- Identify "orphaned" features (CLI features with no GUI equivalent or vice-versa).
- Map each feature to a "User Task" identified in the Analysis phase.

## Deliverables
- Markdown inventory file in `uppsrc/MaestroHub/Feature_Inventory.md`.
