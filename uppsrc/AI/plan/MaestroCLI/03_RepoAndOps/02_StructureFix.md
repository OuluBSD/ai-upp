# Task: Structure Fix Tools
# Status: TODO

## Objective
Implement automated tools to fix U++ project structure and include patterns.

## Requirements
- Implement `fix_header_guards`: Ensure all headers have standard guards.
- Implement `normalize_cpp_includes`: Standardize include paths and ordering.
- Implement `ensure_main_header_content`: Ensure package main headers correctly wrap implementations.
- Implement `reduce_secondary_header_includes`: Optimize compilation by reducing direct inclusions of sub-headers.
